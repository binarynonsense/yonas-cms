This is a quick guide about the main points when installing the CMS
I'll write a more complete document when I have more time, sorry.


*INSTALL:
-copy the contents of the zip files in the destination folder
-change the file named paths.inc.php in the include folder so the paths correspond to the 
ones in your installation.
-you may need to change the permissions of some files or folders so the cms can write in the database 
file (admin/yonas.db)

*ADMINISTER:

you can access the admin area from:
yoursitelink/admin/
deafult user: admin
default password: yonas
[WARNING] you should at least change the password as soon as possible

*Customizing the top menu:

you can do it changing the file named menu1.xml in the admin folder


*creating a new database

in case you want to modify the initial database or see how it was created you can
use/see the file called createdb.php.bak in the admin folder
