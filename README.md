Yonas CMS
=========

Yonas CMS is a content management system (CMS) I made years ago, while learning PHP. This is a beta version I found lying around, I'll try to find the latest version I made and update the repository. In any case, I'm creating this repository mostly just for myself, the cms probably has bugs and security flaws, so it may not be a good choice to use it to run a public website.

More info from the original "Readme":

It's programmed using PHP 5, SQLite, Javascript and AJAX, which makes it portable and hopefully easy to install in a good number of servers.

Initially developed to manage my own website, I am releasing this free (as in freedom) version, so anyone can benefit from it (using it to manage a site, learning from the code...)


This is a Beta version, it's functional but still has a few number of bugs to be repaired and new features to be implemented.
It's open source, so I hope you can at least benefit from reading the source code.
